                <h3>What kind of projects do you usually work on?</h3>
                <p>I mostly work on modern, responsive websites using React, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript. I specialize in clean UI/UX and frontend functionality, from landing pages to web apps.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do you offer design services as well?</h3>
                <p>While I focus on frontend development, I can collaborate with designers or use provided Figma/Adobe files. If needed, I can also help with basic layout design using Tailwind.</p>
