  <h2>Learning to Rest Without Feeling Guilty</h2>
  <p class="meta">Category: Personal | Date: April 30, 2025</p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      There was a time I couldn’t watch a movie without my laptop open. I thought every free hour should be “productive.” But rest isn’t laziness. It’s maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve learned that resting well makes me a better coder, a better collaborator, and a better human. Burnout isn’t just a buzzword, it’s a warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      These days, I block out time for sleep, movies, journaling, even doing nothing. And guess what? My code got cleaner, my ideas sharper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a break. The world will wait. Your brain needs it more than your GitHub streak.

  <h2>From Chaos to Clarity: My Frontend Debugging Workflow</h2>
  <p class="meta">Category: Tips | Date: April 27, 2025</p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Bugs are inevitable. What matters is how you approach them. My debugging process starts with one question: What changed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s my go-to flow:
      <ol>
        <li>Check the console (always!).</li>
        <li>Isolate the problem – comment out chunks of code if needed.</li>
        <li>Reproduce the issue in a sandbox environment.</li>
        <li>Google smarter: include the error message and stack trace.</li>
        <li>If all else fails, step away. Seriously. Take a walk.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Debugging isn’t just a skill, it’s a mindset. Stay calm, stay methodical, and remember: every solved bug is XP earned.

  <h2>What's New in JavaScript ES2025?</h2>
  <p class="meta">Category: Info | Date: April 20, 2025</p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The ECMAScript 2025 update brings several game-changing features to the language we love and hate. Here’s what caught my eye:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pipeline Operator (`|>`):</strong> Makes function chaining cleaner and more readable.</li>
      <li><strong>Explicit Resource Management:</strong> A new `using` keyword to handle resource lifecycles automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Pattern Matching:</strong> Native switch-style destructuring that feels like a dream come true.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These features don’t just improve syntax—they change the way we architect code. The future of JS is less boilerplate, more clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      My advice? Start experimenting now, so when adoption hits mainstream, you’re already ahead.

  <h2>The Problem with Gatekeeping in Frontend Development</h2>
  <p class="meta">Category: Opinion | Date: April 1, 2025</p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Why do we make newcomers feel like they don’t belong unless they know the entire React ecosystem, TypeScript, GraphQL, and can quote Dan Abramov? Tech is already complex, gatekeeping just makes it worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone starts somewhere. No one writes clean code on day one. Mocking someone for not knowing the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` doesn't make you smarter, it makes you part of the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth? Great developers build things, support others, and stay curious. We don’t need rockstars. We need community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s stop gatekeeping and start mentoring. The future of tech depends on how inclusive we are—not how elite we act.

  <h2>Is "Hustle Culture" in Tech Still Cool?</h2>
  <p class="meta">Category: Opinion | Date: March 6, 2025</p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The glorification of 16-hour workdays and sleeping next to your laptop is getting tired. Burnout isn't a badge of honor, and overworking doesn't make you a better developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smart work > hard work. Rested minds build better code. Maybe it's time we stop idolizing the grind and start respecting balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work smarter, log off sometimes, and touch some grass.

  <h2>When Life Feels Like a Console.log Debug</h2>
  <p class="meta">Category: Personal | Date: February 21, 2025</p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Some days feel like you're running life in dev mode, breakpoints everywhere, async tasks piling up, and nothing makes sense unless you console.log your way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that’s okay. Not everything in life compiles on the first try. Sometimes the best thing you can do is pause, refactor your thoughts, and try again with a cleaner state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember: even failed builds are part of the process. Keep shipping.

  <h2>Why Developer Experience (DX) Should Be a Priority</h2>
  <p class="meta">Category: Insights | Date: January 30, 2025</p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Companies obsess over user experience and rightly so. But they often forget the other UX: developer experience. Clean repo structures, clear documentation, readable code... these things aren't just nice. They're essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dev struggling with messy architecture is a dev who writes slower, breaks more, and hates Mondays harder. Happy devs mean faster delivery and better code. Invest in DX.
    </p>
    <p>
      TL;DR: DX isn’t a buzzword, it’s a productivity multiplier.

  <h2>Simple UI Tweaks That Instantly Improve UX</h2>
  <p class="meta">Category: Tips | Date: January 10, 2025</p>
  <div class="content">
    <ul>
      <li>Add a hover state to every clickable element. Don’t make users guess.</li>
      <li>Use modals wisely. Don’t trap users with unnecessary popups.</li>
      <li>Always provide feedback, loading, success, or error. Silence is confusing.</li>
      <li>Space things out. White space is your best friend.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      UX is mostly about empathy. Build interfaces like you're guiding your future self through the dark. You’ll thank yourself later.

      <h2>Why Frontend Developers Should Care About Accessibility</h2>
      <p class="meta">Category: Opinions | Date: January 7, 2025</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Accessibility isn’t just a “nice to have” you kmow it’s a responsibility. The web is for everyone, and that means your product should be usable by all, including those with disabilities. You don't need to be a specialist to care. Start small: use semantic HTML, label your forms, ensure color contrast is readable. It’s part of writing good code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond ethics, it’s also good UX. A screen reader-friendly form is often also more usable to the average user. And guess what? Google loves accessible pages too. SEO boost? Yes please.
        </p>
        <p>
          TL;DR: Make your frontend inclusive. Because you can. Because it matters.
