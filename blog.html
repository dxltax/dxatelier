  <h2>When Life Feels Like a Console.log Debug</h2>
  <p class="meta">Category: Personal | Date: April 21, 2025</p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Some days feel like you're running life in dev mode—breakpoints everywhere, async tasks piling up, and nothing makes sense unless you console.log your way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that’s okay. Not everything in life compiles on the first try. Sometimes the best thing you can do is pause, refactor your thoughts, and try again with a cleaner state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember: even failed builds are part of the process. Keep shipping.

  <h2>Why Developer Experience (DX) Should Be a Priority</h2>
  <p class="meta">Category: Insights | Date: March 30, 2025</p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Companies obsess over user experience—and rightly so. But they often forget the other UX: developer experience. Clean repo structures, clear documentation, readable code... these things aren't just nice. They're essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dev struggling with messy architecture is a dev who writes slower, breaks more, and hates Mondays harder. Happy devs mean faster delivery and better code. Invest in DX.
    </p>
    <p>
      TL;DR: DX isn’t a buzzword—it’s a productivity multiplier.

  <h2>Simple UI Tweaks That Instantly Improve UX</h2>
  <p class="meta">Category: Tips | Date: April 10, 2025</p>
  <div class="content">
    <ul>
      <li>Add a hover state to every clickable element. Don’t make users guess.</li>
      <li>Use modals wisely. Don’t trap users with unnecessary popups.</li>
      <li>Always provide feedback—loading, success, or error. Silence is confusing.</li>
      <li>Space things out. White space is your best friend.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      UX is mostly about empathy. Build interfaces like you're guiding your future self through the dark. You’ll thank yourself later.

      <h2>Why Frontend Developers Should Care About Accessibility</h2>
      <p class="meta">Category: Opinions | Date: May 7, 2025</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Accessibility isn’t just a “nice to have”—it’s a responsibility. The web is for everyone, and that means your product should be usable by all, including those with disabilities. You don't need to be a specialist to care. Start small: use semantic HTML, label your forms, ensure color contrast is readable. It’s part of writing good code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond ethics, it’s also good UX. A screen reader-friendly form is often also more usable to the average user. And guess what? Google loves accessible pages too. SEO boost? Yes please.
        </p>
        <p>
          TL;DR: Make your frontend inclusive. Because you can. Because it matters.

      <h2>5 VS Code Extensions I Can’t Live Without</h2>
      <p class="meta">Category: Tips | Date: May 1, 2025</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Let’s be real—VS Code is already awesome, but with the right extensions? Chef’s kiss. Here are five that supercharged my workflow:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Prettier</strong> – automatic formatting saves my soul daily.</li>
          <li><strong>ESLint</strong> – code linting FTW.</li>
          <li><strong>GitLens</strong> – view git blame like a god.</li>
          <li><strong>Tailwind IntelliSense</strong> – auto-complete Tailwind classes like a pro.</li>
          <li><strong>Live Server</strong> – real-time browser reloads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Try them. Your future self (and your repo collaborators) will thank you.
